# Predicting Avoidable Readmissions in U.S. Hospitals facing re-admission penalties (Diabetes Dataset)
*(U.S. Diabetes Dataset – 30-Day Readmission Prediction)*

---

## Project Details
<br>

Hospital readmissions within 30 days of discharge significantly impact healthcare costs and hospital reimbursement policies in the United States. Under the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program(HRRP) Act, hospitals in the US face financial penalties for violating a certain threshold of such readmissions.

This project builds predictive models to identify high-risk diabetic patients likely to be readmitted within 30 days, using clinical, demographic, and treatment-related features.

**The goal is to:**

* **Predict which patients are highly likely to have readmission within 30 days:** Develop a binary classification model to forecast which patients are likely to return.
* **Identify key risk factors enabling such re-admissions:** Use feature importance to determine which clinical and demographic variables most influence readmission rates.
* **Provide actionable insights to hospitals to avoid such re-admissions:** Offer data-driven insights to help hospitals mitigate penalties under the HRRP.
